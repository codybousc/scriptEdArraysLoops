      1) Create an array of numbers 1 - 6.
Without using loops, console log every even number in the array. (Hint: there will be multiple console.log statements)


      2) Create an array of numbers 1 -10
Using a for loop, loop over this array and console.log every number in the array
Now change the condition so that the loop only console logs numbers that are greater than 5.
Using a for loop, loop over the array and console.log all even numbers. Hint: you need an if condition inside the body of the loop. Also look into the use of Modulo (%)
